However, Clawdites developed an unexpected mutation - the ability to shapechange. The Zolanders deemed the clawdites a dire threat- a devious subspecies filled with wickedness. Therefor to gaurd against Clawdite treachery, the Zolanders sequester them in wretched ghettos, where they live as second-class citizens under the watchful eyes of their captors. The clawdites chafe under the tyrannical yoke place upon them, and those who can, flee, but more languish on their homeworld, struggling to find some way to be free. Count Dooku and the Separatist Movement offered the Clawdites the freedom they craved from the Zolanders, so many enlisted to support Count Dooku's war effort in exchange for his promise. The aid was short lived, for the Separatist Movement unraveleed with Count Dooku's death. Only after the fall of the Empire do the Clawdites finally rise up against the Zolanders, fighting a brutal civil war that comsumes the world in violence. The Clawdites eventually gain control of the planet, and in victory, they assert themselves as the dominat species. Free, the Clawdites court the New Republic and throw their support behind Alliance Intelligence organizations, using their unique talents to infiltrate the Yuuzhan Vong and sabotage equipment, gather intelligence, and assassinate critical targest.

They do not lack the technology or wherewithal to venture out into the stars, but their cultural predilections make such ventures undesirable. The Falleen regard themselves and their civilization to be among the greatest in the galaxy, and looking beyond their world, they find only chaos and strife-the products of crudity and backward beings. Associations with other species, therefor, are risky to the Falleen and are approached with caution. Falleen culture reinforces the sense of superiority that prevades this species. Their rigid caste society confines them to societal roles and provides stability and a sense of purpose. Other systems are far looser, with little to no regard for quality of birth or station.
